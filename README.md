# Tempest-APCMini-StepSeq-Project-Git



A rework of Mark Egloff's and/or Greybot's APC sequencer, located here https://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/877/apc-step-sequencer-by-mark-egloff and herehttps://maxforlive.com/library/index.php?by=any&q=greybot


This is designed specifically for the APC mini (OG). Slight tweaks will be needed for it to operate on other hardware. This is a work in progress and kind of a mess ATM.
